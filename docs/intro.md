# Introduction

Introducing CWScript: a revolutionary new language designed specifically for CosmWasm smart contracts. As a powerful and innovative platform, CosmWasm offers numerous advantages such as enhanced security compared to EVM, an elegant message-passing design, and interchain capabilities at its core. However, despite its potential, CosmWasm remains underutilized and unrecognized due to barriers preventing mass adoption and usage.

One of the primary challenges in CosmWasm adoption is the Rust-based ecosystem, which can be large and intimidating for newcomers. The developer experience in CosmWasm is far from ideal, with missing or incomplete documentation, lack of guidance on best practices, poor standardization, and insufficient models for composability and building large programs. Additionally, the developer interface is clunky, and complexity scales poorly. This is where CWScript enters the picture, offering a simplified syntax that communicates clearly the intent, allowing the language to melt away and reveal the meaning and flow of the program.

CWScript was designed to reduce syntactic noise and create a seamless experience for developers. It achieves this by translating high-level CWScript code into high-quality idiomatic CosmWasm Rust patterns. The design goals of CWScript are centered around a tooling-first approach. This means that CWScript is built with tooling developers in mind, exposing the compiler interface to enable new tools that can deeply introspect and manipulate smart contract logic. **The simplicity of the language allows developers to focus on the complexity of their ideas, rather than wrestling with syntax.**

Future goals for CWScript include generating optimized Rust output that surpasses human-written code, working seamlessly alongside Rust to ensure we don't alienate the existing Rust ecosystem, and making the language extensible through Rust itself. This will empower developers to leverage the best of both worlds: the simplicity of CWScript and the robustness of Rust.

Get ready to embark on an exciting journey as you explore CWScript and its potential to revolutionize the world of CosmWasm smart contracts. This documentation will guide you through every aspect of the language, helping you build secure, efficient, and sophisticated smart contracts with ease. Unleash your creativity and discover how CWScript can transform your development experience and pave the way for a more accessible, innovative, and productive CosmWasm ecosystem.
