# Contracts

In CWScript, a **contract** describes a CosmWasm smart contract.

## Syntax

```cwscript
contract MyToken // required: contract name
    extends BaseContract // optional: inherited base contract
    implements CW2, CW20 // optional: implemented contract interfaces
{
    // ...contract items
}
```

## Concepts

### State

### Messages

### Inheritance

### Interfaces

A contract may implement one or more interfaces. An interface is a set of required entrypoint messages that a contract must implement. Interfaces are used to provide a common API for contracts that share similar functionality.

For instance, the CW20 interface defines a set of entrypoints that a contract must implement in order to be considered a CW20 token contract. This allows a CW20 token contract to be used in any context that expects a CW20 token contract.

```cwscript
interface CW20 {
  // Interfaces may define custom types, but the implementing contract is not
  // obligated to use them.
  struct Coin {
    address: String,
    amount: U128
  }

  event Transfer(from: Address, to: Address, amount: Int)
  event Burn(from: Address, amount: Int)
  event Mint(to: Address, amount: Int)
  event Send(from: Address, to: Address, amount: Int)
  event IncreaseAllowance(owner: Address, spender: Address, amount: Int)
  event DecreaseAllowance(owner: Address, spender: Address, amount: Int)
  event TransferFrom(from: Address, to: Address, by: Address, amount: Int)
  event BurnFrom(from: Address, by: Address, amount: Int)
  event Log(from: Address, to: Address, by: Address, amount: Int)

  // Interfaces may not define any state items, as this would conflict with
  // the contract's own state items.

  // Typically, interfaces will not define any #instantiate entrypoints, as
  // this often conflicts with the contract's own instantiate entrypoint.
  // However, there are cases where it makes sense to define an #instantiate
  // structure for an interface, such as when the implementing contract is
  // expected to be instantiated by a factory contract that expects a specific
  // structure.

  // Required "exec" entrypoints -- the implementing contract must have all of
  // these entrypoints, with the exact same signatures matching in message name,
  // and each parameter's order, name, and type.
  exec #burn(amount: Int)
  exec #mint(recipient: String)
  exec #send(contract: String, amount: Int, msg: Binary)
  exec #increase_allowance(spender: String, amount: Int, expires?: Expiration)
  exec #decrease_allowance(spender: String, amount: Int, expires?: Expiration)
  exec #transfer_from(owner: String, recipient: String, amount: Int)
  exec #burn_from(owner: String, amount: Int)
  exec #send_from(owner: String, contract: String, amount: Int, msg: Binary)

  // Required "query" entrypoints -- same rules as "exec" entrypoints.
  query #balance(address: String) -> struct {
    balance: Int
  }

  query #token_info() -> struct TokenInfo {
    name: String,
    symbol: String,
    decimals: U8,
    total_supply: Int,
  }

  query #minter() -> MinterResponse?

}
```
