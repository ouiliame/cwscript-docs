# Address

## Syntax



## Methods

### :sig:to_bytes
<FnSignature obj="Address" name={"to_bytes"} params={['a']} returnType="Address"/>

Sure! Here's some example documentation for the `Address.to_bytes` function:


The `to_bytes()` method returns the binary representation of an address as a bytes object.

#### Syntax

```python
address.to_bytes()
```

#### Parameters

This method does not take any parameters.

#### Return Value

This method returns a bytes object representing the binary representation of the address.

#### Example

```python
from address import Address

addr = Address('0x7E13FC6A8D6a43bEba54E68f1a8f4aFaBcb4D739')
addr_bytes = addr.to_bytes()
print(addr_bytes.hex())
# Output: '7e13fc6a8d6a43beba54e68f1a8f4afabcb4d739'
```

In this example, we create an `Address` object representing an Ethereum address and then call the `to_bytes()` method to obtain its binary representation as a bytes object. We then print the hexadecimal representation of the bytes object to the console.

#### Notes

The `to_bytes()` method can be used to obtain the binary representation of an address that can be passed to other functions or contracts that require a binary representation of the address.

### :sig:to_bytes2
