## `$` - This Contract

The `$` variable is a reference to the contract instance itself.

```cwscript
const $: Instance<...>
```

The most common use case for `$` is to make queries or call contract `exec` messages against the current contract instance.

```cwscript
query! $.balance(...)
exec! $.another_exec_msg(...)
```

## `$state` - Contract State

The `$state` variable is a reference to the contract state, so its structure will vary depending on the contract.
It is available in all special contexts, but read-only in the `query` context.

```cwscript
const $state: ContractState<...>
```

## `$env` - Environment

The `$env` variable is a reference to the current contract's environment, which contains information about the current block, transaction, and contract.

```cwscript
const $env: struct Env {
  block: struct BlockInfo {
    height: Uint64,
    time: Uint64,
    chain_id: String
  },
  transaction: struct TransactionInfo {
    index: Uint32,
  }?,
  contract: struct ContractInfo {
    address: Address
  },
}
```

## `$info` - Message Info

The `$info` variable provides information about the transactional message used to invoke a contract state-mutating entrypoint.
It is only available in the `instantiate` and `exec` contexts.

```cwscript
const $info: struct MessageInfo {
  sender: Address,
  funds: Coins,
}
```

## `$response` - Contract Response

The `$response` variable is a mutable reference to the `Response` of the current contract invocation.
It is only available in the `instantiate`, `exec`, `reply.on_success`, and `reply.on_error` contexts.

```cwscript
let $response: struct Response {
  messages: ExecMsg[],
  events: Event[],
  data: Bytes?,
}
```

## `$data` - SubMsg Data
The `$data` variable is a reference to the `data` field of submessage's `Response` during `reply.on_success` context.

```cwscript
const $data: Bytes?
```

## `$events` - SubMsg Events
The `$events` variable is a reference to the `events` field of submessage's `Response` during `reply.on_success` context.

```cwscript
const $events: Event[]
```

## `$error` - SubMsg Error
The `$error` variable is a reference to the `error` field of submessage's `Response` during `reply.on_error` context.

```cwscript
const $error: Error
```
