# Instantiate

## Defining `#instantiate`

Inside a contract definition, you can define the  `#instantiate` message like this:

```cwscript
contract MyContract {
	#instantiate() {
		// do some stuff
	}
}
```

## Building `instantiate` Messages

You can build an `instantiate` message without calling it by using the `instantiate` keyword.
This is useful for building a message to be called later, or storing it as data.

```cwscript
let instantiate_msg = instantiate #MyContract()

// instantiate later
instantiate! instantiate_msg {
  code_id: 9
}
```


## The `instantiate!` Keyword

You can use the `instantiate!` keyword to instantiate a new contract. The contract code must be stored at a known "code ID" prior to instantiating, which is provided in arguments after the specifying the new contract's instantiate message.

:::caution
Some chains also require you to specify additional arguments such as `label` or `admin` information. Be sure to check the specifications of your target platform chain before deploying your contract.
:::


```cwscript
instantiate! #CW20() {
	code_id: 20,
	// label: "cw20-token",
	// admin: $env.contract.address
}
```

### Deferred `instantiate!`

After using the `instantiate!` keyword, you cannot perform further updates to `$state`. In order to work around this, use the `defer` keyword before `instantiate!`, which delays instantiate until the end of the message's execution by appending the instantiate message to a queue.


```cwscript
contract DeferInstantaiteExample {
	exec #crate_contracts(n: Int) {
		for i in 0..n {
			defer instantiate! #CW20() {
				code_id: 20,
				label: "token-{i}",
				admin: $env.contract.address
			}
			$state.new_contracts += 1
		}
	}
}
```
