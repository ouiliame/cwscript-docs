# Errors

In CWScript, **errors** are a special type of value used to indicate that something went wrong. 

Unlike Rust, CWScript does not use the `Result` monad to capture errors to be processed later, and instead requires you to deal with errors when they occur, or fail immediately.

## Defining Errors

You can define custom errors using the `error` keyword.

Errors may contain fields, which are specified using the **functional syntax** for structs.

```cwscript
error SomethingWentWrong(message: String)
error Unauthorized(user: Address, action: String)
```

## The `fail!` Keyword

The `fail!` keyword is used to terminate execution of the current function or message handler.

You can only use `fail!` inside a fallible function or a contract entrypoint.

```cwscript
fn do_some_stuff!() {
  fail! SomethingWentWrong("Oops!")
}
```

## Try / Catch / Else

You can use the `try` keyword to catch errors thrown by a function or message handler.

```cwscript
try {
  do_some_stuff!()
} catch e: SomethingWentWrong {
  // Handle the error
} else {
  // Handles all other errors
}
```

### The `??` Operator

The `??` operator is a shorthand for `try` / `else`.

```cwscript
let a = do_some_stuff!() ?? 5

// Equivalent to:
let a = try {
  do_some_stuff!()
} else {
  5
}
```
